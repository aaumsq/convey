Each figure for the document is produced as follows:

- In the PowerPoint file Figures.pptx, create a fresh blank-template
      slide and draw the figure

- In PowerPoint, with this slide as the current slide,
     - Select menu item:    File -> Save As Pictures
          and give it the file name for this figure (Fig_foo.jpg)
          and save it in this Figures directory
     - It will save the entire current slide as a JPEG image file (Fig_foo.jpg)

- Open Fig_foo.jpg in an image-manipulation program and crop the
      figure to a rectangle that tightly encloses the figure contents,
      and save it.
    - On Mac OS X, you can use the default "Preview" program that opens JPEG files
    - On Linux, presumably one can use GIMP

- This final Fig_foo.jpg can now be imported into the LaTeX file for
    the document (see several examples of such imports already in the
    LaTeX file).

Note: There may still be some legacy figures in the directory that
   were created using an older process, which used Inkscape for
   drawing (.svg file) and exported it as a .pdf which is imported by
   LaTex.  These should disappear after being redrawn using the new
   technique.
