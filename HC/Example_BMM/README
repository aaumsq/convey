        //    export MC_XBAR = 1
        //    export MC_READ_ORDER = 1

    cd Personality/phys
    make cae_fpga.xst
        // Edit the file cae_fpga.xst as follows:
        //    -fsm_extract YES => NO
        //    -resource_sharing YES => NO
        //    -equivalent_register_removal YES => NO
    make    // to create the bitfile
